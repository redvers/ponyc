## Create a standalone libponyc on Linux

It's possible to use libponyc from projects other than ponyc. Using the
library gives you access to all the various compiler functionality. However,
it is hard to use the library because, you need to link in the correct libstdc++,
libblake, and LLVM. Figuring out what is the correct version of each is very
difficult.

With this change, a new library `libponyc-standalone.a` will be created as
part of the build process.

Applications like the "in pony documentation generator" that we are working on will
be able to link to libponyc-standalone and pick up all it's required dependencies.

Windows, BSD, and macOS libraries are not created at this time but can be added
as needed in the future.
